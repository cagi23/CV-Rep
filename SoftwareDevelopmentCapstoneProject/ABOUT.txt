Project: Campus Explorer

Universities are big places, and involve a large number of people doing a variety of tasks. The goal of this project is to provide a way to perform some of the tasks required to run the university and to enable effective querying of the metadata from around campus.

This will be a full stack web development project split into four sprints (d0-d3). The first three sprints are server-side development using Node. The fourth sprint involves client-side development.

Development will be done with TypeScript and the packages and libraries you use will be strictly limited (for the first three sprints). If you do not know TypeScript, you are encouraged to start investigating the language soon. Its syntax is extremely similar to Java so it should be relatively easy to transition to given your prior experience. It is important to note we will not be explicitly teaching TypeScript in this course; you will be expected to learn it on your own time.
